        <strong>Phishing scam</strong> is when someone sends you a fake message
        that looks real. It could be an email, an SMS, or a message on social
        media. They may pretend to be someone you know or a company you trust,
        such as your bank or a shop. The aim is to trick you into giving them
        personal information or money.

        <strong>
          Phishing scams can cause serious problems by stealing your personal
          information
        </strong>
        , letting scammers log into your accounts and pretend to be you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many scammers are after money. If they get your banking details, they
        may <strong>steal money</strong>, make purchases, or lock you out of
        your account. Some phishing scams
        <strong> install harmful software</strong> that shows unwanted ads,
        steals files, or tracks what you type.
        <br />
        <br />
        Being tricked by a phishing scam can lead to lost money, stolen
        accounts, and serious security risks. That's why it's important to stay
        alert and think before you click.
